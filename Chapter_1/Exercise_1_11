Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program?  What kinds of
input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

I would give an input with multiple whitespace in between the words. Divide words by newline
and test if it is giving the correct output. Include special characters and
numerical characters in between the words.
